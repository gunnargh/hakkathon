import 'score_function.dart';

/*
Create a function called CheckIfBusted.

This function should accept a List
of integers (hand of cards) calculate the score, and return true if busted
ie. score is above 21, and false if not busted.

just make sure to merge them once you are done.

Example inputs

[10 11 1] -> False
[13 13 7] -> True
[1 1 2] -> True
...ie use output of score function and check if busted.
