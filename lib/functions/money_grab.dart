Create two functions called

PlaceBet(int currentBank)
- Asks the user how much they want to bet this round, return the amount.
- Solve edge cases when the bet is larger than current bank or if
the user chooses to bet 0.

BuyIn
- Ask the user for how much they want to buy in to black jack

These methods should return an integer.

BONUS POINTS:

he doesn't input a integer?
